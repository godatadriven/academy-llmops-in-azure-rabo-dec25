    "For evaluation, we need to run multiple articles through the LLM to get a good sense of its performance.\n",
    "Currently, our entire pipeline is synchronous, which means we have to wait for each article to be processed before we can move on to the next one. Furthermore, even within our pipeline, we have to wait for each task to be completed before we can move on to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous calls can be immensely helpful here, as they allow us to send multiple requests to the LLM at once. For evaluation, this means that we can pass multiple articles through the LLM system at the same time. And for our pipeline, this means that we can even gather information about different businesses in parallel.\n",

    "We won't build out the full pipeline like this in this training, but as a bunus exercise, you can try to implement async calls to get the business information for multiple companies at once.\n"
