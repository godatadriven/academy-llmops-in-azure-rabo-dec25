England's decision to start George Furbank at full-back against Scotland is an "attack-minded selection" but "very unlike Steve Borthwick", says former England wing Ugo Monye.
Head coach Borthwick has dropped Freddie Steward for Saturday's Six Nations match at Murrayfield.
Furbank, 27, has been in superb form for Premiership leaders Northampton.
"Furbank just raises the potential of the attack in this team," Monye told the BBC Rugby Union Daily podcast.
"I really rate Steward and when he's played for England he's been very good, he's very dependable.
"Furbank coming in at 15 heightens the ability of England to be able to attack, and be more coherent, dangerous and score more points.
"This is an attack-minded selection, the only reason I'm surprised by it is that it's very unlike [head coach] Steve Borthwick. This England team wants to move on and progress. This could be a real point of difference for England."

England arrive at Murrayfield having narrowly won two from two against Italy and Wales in this year's Six Nations.
Borthwick's side have won eight of their past nine Test matches. Their only defeat was a one-point loss in the World Cup semi-final against eventual champions South Africa.
England's head coach is considered to be conservative in his approach to the game but he made another surprise selection when he dropped Steward and played Marcus Smith at full-back for a game at last year's World Cup, rather than in his usual fly-half role.
Steward has been a consistent presence for England in the number 15 shirt since his debut in 2021, but Furbank, set to win his seventh cap, offers extra speed and playmaking abilities.
He made his debut against France in 2020, later admitting he was disappointed with his own performance as England lost 24-17 in Paris.
Six days later Furbank was part of the England side who beat Scotland 13-6in awful weather conditions - England's last Calcutta Cup win.
"There's a couple of bits I've been working on and I feel like I'm in a better place as an all-round player," Furbank told BBC Sport.
"I've got a bit bigger, that has helped my game. I've taken up more of a leadership role at Saints.
"I'm quite realistic with myself, I know that I'm not a player who can be in average form and make an England squad.
"I don't necessarily think I saw the selection coming. Freddie [Steward] has been in great form the last few games, playing really well.
"His consistency is something I strive for as well. That's something I want to develop in my game."
