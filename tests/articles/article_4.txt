Before setting himself on fire, he said he would "no longer be complicit in genocide" and he was heard shouting "Free Palestine" as he burned.
A bomb disposal unit was sent to the site over concerns about a suspicious vehicle that could have been connected to the individual.
This was later declared safe after no hazardous materials were found.
No embassy staff members were injured in the incident, said a spokeswoman for the embassy.
